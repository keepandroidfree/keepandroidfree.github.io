# Keep Android Open

In August 2025, Google announced that starting next year,
it will no longer be possible to develop apps for the Android platform
without first registering centrally with Google.

This registration will involve:

- Paying a fee to Google
- Agreeing to Google's Terms and Conditions
- Providing government identification
- Uploading evidence of an app's private signing key
- Listing all current and future application identifiers

Some actions you can take to help oppose the enactment of this policy are:

## Sign the Open Letter
- Add your organization's signature to the draft [Open Letter to Google Regarding Mandatory Developer Registration for Third-Party App Distribution](https://docs.fediverse.foundation/pad/#/2/pad/view/OkfvdusnqafC8Wv+WUVpXB8RQk6XUFxmFHIa6CiBxQI/).

## European Union
- Send feedback on EU Digital Fairness Act: [EU Digital Fairness Act: Have Your Say](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14622-Digital-Fairness-Act_en)

## United States
