# Keep Android Open

In August 2025, Google announced that starting next year,
it will no longer be possible to develop apps for the Android platform
without first registering centrally with Google. This registration will involve:

- Paying a fee to Google
- Agreeing to their terms and conditions
- Providing government identification for the developer
- Uploading evidence of an app's private signing key
- Listing all current and future application identifiers

Some actions you can take to help support the opposition to
the enactment of this policy are:

## European Union
- Send feedback on EU Digital Fairness Act: [EU Digital Fairness Act: Have Your Say](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14622-Digital-Fairness-Act_en)

## United States
- Make a report to to [US Department of Justice Antitrust Report Online](https://www.justice.gov/atr/webform/submit-your-antitrust-report-online) and [US Federal Trade Commission: Antitrust Complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/advice-guidance/competition-guidance/antitrust-complaint-intake)
